                      Ear Training Specification

Basic Structure:
  EarTraining:  This is the application module.  It instantiates and owns the other modules.
                It builds the interface.
  Keyboard:     This module is a piano keyboard that is used for indicating which notes are being
                played, and also to allow the user to play a note.
  Notation:	    This module displays the notes being played as a musical score.  It does not support input.
  Player:       This module plays the sounds.
  Tester:       This module runs the tests and records the results.
  Options:      This module displays and updates the options.
  Sounds:       This module downloads and contains all of the sounds.
  Results:      This module displays the results.

Assets:
  The piano samples were taken from the Audacity project:

  Note names have been replaced with MIDI numbers.

- Build in stages:
  + Minimum functionality first:
    ~ Download sounds, , piano keyboard, one octave

Questions:
- Is a UI framework necessary?
- Is JQuery necessary?
- Is Bootstrap necessary?
  + Bootstrap's primary value is in responsive websites, which doesn't
    really help this project.  The responsiveness of the app will need
    to be handled by code.
  + The size and layout of the controls and canvas elements
    should be kept as simple as possible, while maintaining
    good functionality.
- Right click menus?
- PHP storage of data?
-


Future:
- Possibly make this an app for Bruce Arnold.
- MIDI
- Web Audio sounds before upgrade
- PHP storage of data
