The individual notes were generated by the NormalizedOneOctave Audacity project, which uses
samples downloaded from the University of Iowa.  These files were then trimmed to no lead in, and
a consistent duration of 5 seconds, with  a Fade Out effect applied from 2 seconds to 5 seconds.
They were converted to MP3 at 128kbs with joint stereo enabled.
